##  About the Project

**BookMyDOC** is an advanced healthcare appointment system designed to bridge the gap between patients and doctors through a seamless, intuitive web interface. It simplifies the process of booking consultations, accessing prescriptions from doctors, and managing health records ‚Äî all from one place.

BookMyDoc serves as a centralized medical platform for both patients and doctors. The project allows patients to search for nearby doctors, make appointments based on availability and receive AI-based recommendations. Doctors can view upcoming appointments, maintain medical histories, generate digital prescriptions, and manage their schedules.
